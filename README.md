## 🛠️ How It Works

The timer runs through a standard Pomodoro cycle:

1. Focus (25 min)  
2. Short break (5 min)  
3. Repeat 4x → Long break (15 min)  
4. New cycle starts manually

Each session and cycle is tracked and stored locally using your browser’s storage. No internet connection is required after the initial load.
