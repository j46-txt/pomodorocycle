# PomodoroCycle ⏱️🍅

**PomodoroCycle** is a free, ad-free, and open-source Pomodoro timer that works offline after the initial load. It’s designed for focused work, study, and productivity, with simplicity and usability in mind.
I originally built it for personal use, since I couldn’t find a free timer with the features I wanted. As the project grew, I added translations and decided to share it as a web app, in case it’s helpful to others too.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The timer runs through a standard Pomodoro cycle:

1. Focus (25 min)  
2. Short break (5 min)  
3. Repeat 4x → Long break (15 min)  
4. New cycle starts manually

Each session and cycle is tracked and stored locally using your browser’s storage. No internet connection is required after the initial load.
